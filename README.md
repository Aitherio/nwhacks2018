NWHacks 2018 Hackathon Jan 13-14

## Coffee Runner chatbot using AWS and Slack API

This is a chatbot that allows a user who is going on a coffee run to grab everyone's order into a list without the user phyiscally needing to ask the others what they want, let the bot do the work.

Although it is currently a WIP (yes even though its after the hackathon) we have learned a lot about the chatbot framework despite that none of us have ever touched it before.

## Inspiration
It was midnight and our original plan didn't work, so Sassy Serena came out of her shell and wanted to do something with a coffee related topic, and we went with it ... halfway through the hackathon haha
